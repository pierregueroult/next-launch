# Next Launch ðŸš€

A free and open source web app boilerplate based on Next.js, offering you an easy way to get started with your next project. It includes a set of tools and best practices that will help you to build your web application in a fast, efficient and scalable way. This is a headless project, meaning that it doesn't include any styled UI, now you're the one who decides how your app will look like.

## Features

- Authentication with [AuthJS](https://authjs.dev/)
- Emails with [React Email](https://react.email/) and [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/)
- Database with [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), [Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- Styling with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pierregueroult/next-launch.git
```

2. Install the dependencies with pnpm:

```bash
pnpm install
```

(You can also use your favorite package manager like bun, I like bun actually)

3. Start all the things you need:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

```bash
pnpm email:dev
```

```bash
pnpm database:up
```

4.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Et voilÃ ! You're ready to start building your app. ðŸš€
